### Work Log: August 12, 2025 - Enhanced Reservation Type Creation

Today, I focused on a major enhancement to the admin panel, specifically for creating new reservation types. The goal was to move beyond simply creating a "type" and instead allow an admin to define a complete weekly schedule associated with that type in a single action.

#### 1. API Logic with a PostgreSQL Function

Instead of making multiple separate calls from the frontend, I decided the best approach was to create a single, robust backend function.

- **Created `create_reservation_type_with_schedule` RPC:** I wrote a PostgreSQL function that accepts all the necessary details for a new reservation offering:
  - Type details (name, description, price).
  - Schedule details (start time, end time, days of the week).
  - Capacity (`max_capacity`).
- **Atomic Operations:** This function handles creating records in `reservation_type`, `time_slots`, and `reservation_slots` within a single transaction. This ensures data integrityâ€”either the entire schedule is created, or nothing is.

#### 2. API Layer Integration

I updated my API abstraction layers to connect the frontend to this new backend logic.

- **Provider Update:** I added a new function `createReservationTypeWithScheduleBackend` to my Supabase provider (`reservationTypeProvider.js`) to call the new RPC.
- **Facade Update:** I exposed this new functionality through my `ReservationTypeAPI` facade, creating a new method `createReservationTypeWithSchedule`. This method includes validation for all the new form fields to ensure the data is correct before it even hits the backend.

#### 3. Frontend Form Enhancement

The biggest user-facing change was updating the form in `AdminTypesComponent.jsx`.

- **Expanded `NewTypeForm.jsx`:** I modified the form to include new input fields for:
  - Max Capacity (number input).
  - Start and End Time (time inputs).
  - Days of the Week (a set of 7 checkboxes).
- **State Management:** I updated the React state to handle the new, more complex form structure, including the nested `timeSlot` object. I also refactored the state handling to be cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Submission Logic:** I wired the form's `onSubmit` handler to call the new `ReservationTypeAPI.createReservationTypeWithSchedule` function, passing the complete data object.
